# Antenna from Failed Parts

## Options
- **Monopole**: single lead as λ/4; chassis ground as return.
- **Dipole**: two failed components, leads opposite directions ~λ/2 total.
- **Loop**: open-winding inductor; small loops at VHF/UHF ≈ near-field tag.

## Cut lengths (free-space; shorten ~5–10% for loading)
- 433 MHz: λ/4 ≈ 17.3 cm
- 915 MHz: λ/4 ≈ 8.2 cm
- 2.4 GHz: λ/4 ≈ 3.1 cm
