# Optical Fallback â€” Photodiode Receiver (Stub)

## Concept
Failed photodiodes and even open LEDs can sense flicker. Use as low-cost receivers for optical fallback channels.

## Characteristics
- Detect visible/IR light pulses
- Sensitivity: tens of lux to faint moonlight
- Accuracy: depends on amplifier quality
