# Optical Fallback — LED Blink Code (Stub)

## Concept
Failed LEDs can still emit weak light. Reverse-biased, they also act as crude photodiodes. Use this duality to form optical links.

## Applications
- Morse distress beacons
- Pulse codes readable by camera/photodiode
- QR-like flicker codes for visual pickup

## Characteristics
- Range: cm–10 m
- Bandwidth: 1–10 kbps (MCU-driven)
- Survivability: LEDs degrade but often remain semi-functional
