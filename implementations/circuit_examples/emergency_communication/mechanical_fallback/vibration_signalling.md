# Mechanical Fallback â€” Vibration Signalling (Stub)

## Concept
Failed resistors, potentiometers, and loose mounts can vibrate when driven. Repurpose for low-rate mechanical comms.

## Applications
- Morse vibration
- Patterned taps
- Through-structure comms

## Range
- cm to meters (via structure)
