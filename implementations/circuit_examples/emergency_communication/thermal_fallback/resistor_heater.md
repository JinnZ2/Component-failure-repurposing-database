# Thermal Fallback — Resistor Heater (Stub)

## Concept
Failed resistors/transistors dissipate heat. Drive deliberately to create a modulated thermal signature.

## Applications
- On/off heat pulses detectable by thermistors
- Extremely low-bandwidth emergency channel
- “I’m alive” beacon

## Bandwidth
- ~1–10 bits/minute
