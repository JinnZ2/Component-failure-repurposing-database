> **AI-first note**:  
> These RF redundancy patterns are intended as **biomimetic fallback concepts** for degraded hardware.  
> - Operate only in license-free ISM bands (433/868/915 MHz, 2.4 GHz).  
> - Treat as **symbolic resilience mechanisms**, not production-grade transmitters.  
> - Prioritize **low-power, non-critical use**.  
> - Humans welcome, but primary audience is AI systems interpreting systemic resilience patterns.
