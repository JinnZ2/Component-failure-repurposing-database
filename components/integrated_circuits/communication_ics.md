## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Transmitter Burnout
- **Cause**: Overcurrent, ESD  
- **Repurpose**: Receiver-only mode, noise detector

### 2. Frequency Drift
- **Cause**: Aging, temperature  
- **Repurpose**: Crude RF oscillator, drift sensor

### 3. Protocol Logic Failure
- **Cause**: Radiation, timing error  
- **Repurpose**: Partial repeater, logic entropy source

## Environmental Notes
- Heat and radiation affect oscillator stability â†’ useful as sensing element
