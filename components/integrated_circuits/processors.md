# Processor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
CPUs and DSPs used for general computing and signal processing.

---

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Partial Core Failure
- **Cause**: Thermal stress, manufacturing defect  
- **Repurpose**: Reduced-core computing, task-specific engine

### 2. Cache Errors
- **Cause**: Radiation, bit flips  
- **Repurpose**: Entropy source, partial memory buffer

### 3. I/O Bus Failure
- **Cause**: Driver burnout  
- **Repurpose**: Internal ALU reuse as math co-processor (if accessible)

## Environmental Notes
- Radiation and heat accelerate bit errors  
- Still usable in controlled/reduced roles
