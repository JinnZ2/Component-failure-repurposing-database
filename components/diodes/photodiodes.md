## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Dark Current Increase
- **Cause**: Radiation, contamination, aging  
- **Repurpose**: Noise source, crude radiation detector

### 2. Sensitivity Loss
- **Cause**: UV damage, package yellowing  
- **Repurpose**: Binary light/dark detection

### 3. Open Circuit
- **Cause**: Bond fracture  
- **Repurpose**: Spacer, antenna stub

## Environmental Notes
- Dark current rises with temperature  
- Humidity and contamination can permanently alter sensitivity
