# LED Diode Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Light-emitting diodes used for indication and illumination.

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Open Circuit
- **Cause**: Wire bond fracture, overheating  
- **Repurpose**: Optical window (plastic lens), PCB spacer

### 2. Reduced Emission
- **Cause**: Aging, phosphor degradation  
- **Repurpose**: Light sensor (measure weak emission response in reverse bias)

### 3. Short Circuit
- **Cause**: Catastrophic junction failure  
- **Repurpose**: Low-value resistor, crude thermal mass

## Environmental Notes
- Heat accelerates emission drop-off  
- Radiation alters emission wavelength and intensity, usable as detector
