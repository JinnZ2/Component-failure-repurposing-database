# Transformer Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Magnetically coupled inductors used for isolation, voltage conversion, and impedance matching.

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Open Winding
- **Cause**: Wire break, thermal stress  
- **Repurpose**: Remaining windings usable as inductor or choke

### 2. Shorted Turns
- **Cause**: Insulation breakdown  
- **Repurpose**: Crude heating element, EMI suppression

### 3. Core Damage
- **Cause**: Cracking, saturation  
- **Repurpose**: Ferrite fragments as EMI absorbers

## Environmental Notes
- **Temperature**: Increases winding resistance  
- **Humidity**: Can accelerate insulation breakdown

## Next Steps
- Collect partial winding re-use case studies  
- Add environmental degradation data
