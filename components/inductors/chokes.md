# Choke Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Inductors designed for EMI suppression in power and signal lines.

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Open Winding
- **Cause**: Mechanical or thermal stress  
- **Repurpose**: Ferrite body usable as EMI absorber, mechanical support

### 2. Saturation / Core Damage
- **Cause**: Overcurrent, heat stress  
- **Repurpose**: Crude thermal sink, partial inductor for low-current filtering

### 3. Resistance Drift
- **Cause**: Corrosion, partial shorting  
- **Repurpose**: Heating element, stress indicator

## Environmental Notes
- **Temperature**: Increased core losses at high temps  
- **Humidity**: Leads corrode, affecting resistance
