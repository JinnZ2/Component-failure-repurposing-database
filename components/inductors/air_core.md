# Air-Core Inductor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Inductors without magnetic cores, typically used in RF circuits for tuning and filtering.

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Open Winding
- **Cause**: Wire break, solder fracture  
- **Repurpose**: Coil form usable as antenna, PCB spacer

### 2. Mechanical Deformation
- **Cause**: Bending, vibration damage  
- **Repurpose**: Altered inductance can serve as crude strain sensor

---

## Environmental Notes
- **Temperature**: Minimal effect (no core), resistance of wire ↑ with heat  
- **Vibration**: Coil deformation → variable inductance, exploitable for sensing

## Next Steps
- Measure inductance shift under stress  
- Document antenna repurposing effectiveness
