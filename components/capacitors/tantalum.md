# Tantalum Capacitor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Compact, high-density capacitors widely used in portable electronics.

---

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Short Circuit
- **Cause**: Dielectric rupture, manufacturing defect  
- **Repurpose**: Fused link in non-critical paths

### 2. Capacitance Loss
- **Cause**: Aging, thermal/mechanical stress  
- **Repurpose**: Spacer, weak timing element

### 3. Increased Leakage
- **Cause**: Defect growth, radiation exposure  
- **Repurpose**: Leakage as environmental sensor (temp/humidity correlation)

---

## Environmental Notes
- **Temperature**: Leakage â†‘ with heat  
- **Humidity**: Accelerates failure progression  

---

## Next Steps
- Capture leakage-current profiles  
- Add implementation examples for sensing repurpose
