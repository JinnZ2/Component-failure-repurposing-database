## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Dry-Out / Capacitance Loss
- **Cause**: Electrolyte evaporation, aging  
- **Repurpose**: Insulating spacer, low-value residual capacitance for timing

### 2. Short Circuit
- **Cause**: Dielectric breakdown, electrolyte failure  
- **Repurpose**: Fused link, thermal mass for heat spreading

### 3. Increased ESR
- **Cause**: Aging, ripple current stress  
- **Repurpose**: Crude heating element, ESR as sensing element (health monitor)

## Environmental Notes
- **Temperature**: Dry-out accelerates >85Â°C  
- **Humidity**: Swelling and leakage increase at high RH

## Next Steps
- Collect ESR vs age data  
- Document leakage vs humidity for sensor applications
