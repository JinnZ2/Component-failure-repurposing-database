## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Dielectric Breakdown
- **Cause**: Overvoltage, pulse stress  
- **Repurpose**: Fused protection element, parasitic capacitance still usable

### 2. Capacitance Drift
- **Cause**: Aging, thermal cycling  
- **Repurpose**: Crude timing element, environmental drift sensor

### 3. Open Leads
- **Cause**: Mechanical fracture  
- **Repurpose**: Spacer, mechanical stability element

## Environmental Notes
- **Temperature**: Stable over wide range, drift at >125Â°C  
- **Radiation**: Alters dielectric constant slightly

## Next Steps
- Add measured drift values  
- Document RF/EMI suppression uses of failed film caps
