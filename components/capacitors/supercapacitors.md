# Supercapacitor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
High-capacitance energy storage devices bridging batteries and capacitors.

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Capacitance Fade
- **Cause**: Aging, repeated cycling  
- **Repurpose**: Large ESR → heating element, residual capacitance → backup timing

### 2. Increased ESR
- **Cause**: Electrolyte degradation  
- **Repurpose**: Crude resistive load, health monitoring sensor

### 3. Mechanical Swelling
- **Cause**: Gas formation during aging/failure  
- **Repurpose**: Pressure indicator (mechanical stress sensing)

## Environmental Notes
- **Temperature**: Cycling stability ↓ at low temps, ESR ↑  
- **Humidity**: Minimal direct impact (sealed cans), but case corrosion possible

## Next Steps
- Document ESR vs cycle count curves  
- Add case-studies for reusing partially degraded supercaps
