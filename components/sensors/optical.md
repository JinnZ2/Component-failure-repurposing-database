# Optical Sensor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Light-sensitive devices (photodiodes, phototransistors, CCD/CMOS).

---

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Dark Current Increase
- **Cause**: Radiation, aging  
- **Repurpose**: Random noise generator, radiation detector

### 2. Reduced Sensitivity
- **Cause**: UV damage, contamination  
- **Repurpose**: Binary light/dark detector

---

## Environmental Notes
- Sensitive to radiation (usable as dosimeter)  
- Contamination can convert device into crude scatter sensor
