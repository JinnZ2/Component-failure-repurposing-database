# Pressure Sensor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Sensors that detect force, pressure, or strain (piezoelectric, capacitive, MEMS).

---

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Reduced Sensitivity
- **Cause**: Aging, fatigue of diaphragm  
- **Repurpose**: Binary on/off threshold detector

### 2. Mechanical Damage
- **Cause**: Crack, delamination  
- **Repurpose**: Vibration or shock indicator

## Environmental Notes
- Thermal cycling changes calibration  
- Humidity ingress alters capacitance, can be repurposed as humidity sensor
