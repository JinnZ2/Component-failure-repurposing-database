# Magnetic Sensor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Hall-effect sensors, magnetoresistive sensors, and compasses.

---

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Offset Drift
- **Cause**: Thermal stress, aging  
- **Repurpose**: Relative change detector (motion, presence)

### 2. Loss of Sensitivity
- **Cause**: Shock, radiation  
- **Repurpose**: Threshold switch for large fields

## Environmental Notes
- Heat alters offset but usable for relative sensing  
- Radiation increases noise â†’ possible entropy source
