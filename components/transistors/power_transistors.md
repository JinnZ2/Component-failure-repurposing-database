# Power Transistor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
High-current/high-voltage transistors used in power regulation.

## Common Failure Modes
- **Short Circuit** → repurpose as low-ohm resistor or heat spreader  
- **Open Circuit** → spacer, antenna stub  
- **Gain Degradation** → noise source, radiation/leakage sensor

## Next Steps
Expand with measured data, environmental response, and case studies.
