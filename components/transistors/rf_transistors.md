# RF Transistor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Transistors designed for RF amplification and switching.

## Common Failure Modes
- **Gain Collapse** → use as noise source  
- **Open Junction** → antenna stub  
- **Partial Leakage** → crude RF detector

## Next Steps
Document frequency-dependent effects, parasitics, and field-use examples.
