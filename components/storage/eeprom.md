# EEPROM Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Electrically erasable memory for small-scale configuration data.

---

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Write Failure
- **Cause**: Endurance wear-out  
- **Repurpose**: Permanent storage for calibration constants

### 2. Data Retention Loss
- **Cause**: Aging, temperature stress  
- **Repurpose**: Drift tracking, entropy generation

---

## Environmental Notes
- Retention decreases at high temp  
- Radiation induces bit flips, usable for detection
