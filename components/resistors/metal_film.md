# Metal Film Resistor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
Precision resistors with tighter tolerance and lower noise than carbon.

## Common Failure Modes
### 1) Open Circuit
- **Repurpose**: Spacer; very low parasitic C for RF decoupling

### 2) Value Drift (smaller than carbon)
- **Repurpose**: Temperature probe (still stable enough for calibration)

### 3) Short
- **Repurpose**: Low-ohm link; current sensor (mV per amp)

## Environmental Notes
- Better temp stability than carbon; drift mostly from moisture ingress at ends
