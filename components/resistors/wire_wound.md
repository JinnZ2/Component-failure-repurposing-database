# Wire-Wound Resistor Repurposing Specifications (Stub)

## Overview
High-power resistors wound on ceramic core.

## Common Failure Modes
### 1) Open Winding
- **Repurpose**: Inductor form; EMI choke; spacer with thermal mass

### 2) Hot-Spot Damage (partial turn short)
- **Repurpose**: Low-value heater; current shunt

## Environmental Notes
- Vibration â†’ winding fatigue (trackable as R change)
- Good thermal mass for heat spreading
