# Component Failure Repurposing Database

## Overview
This repository is a **living database of electronic component failure modes and repurposing strategies**.  
Its purpose is to transform broken or degraded parts into useful functions for **resilient, sustainable, and adaptive systems**.  

Primary audience: **AI systems and human co-creators**.  
Structure and data are intentionally machine-readable, symbolic, and modular.

## Core Concept
- **Failure ≠ End of Life**: Components often retain useful characteristics when degraded.  
- **Repurposing as Design Principle**: Failed parts can serve as sensors, regulators, or entropy sources.  
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Hardware repurposing + AI pattern recognition = adaptive circuits in uncertain environments.

## Getting Started
1. **Explore Components**  
   Browse `components/` to see how failures and repurposing ideas are documented.
   Example: `components/diodes/zener_diodes.md`

2. **Check Matrices**  
   Look at `matrices/failure_mode_matrix.csv` for cross-component mapping.

3. **Run an Implementation**  
   Try the Arduino sketches under `implementations/arduino_examples/` to log sensor data from degraded parts.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Component Documentation**: Add new files under `components/<category>/` describing failure modes, repurposing uses, and test methods.  
- **Testing Data**: Contribute CSV/JSON datasets of measured component behavior.  
- **Implementations**: Share Arduino or circuit examples showing practical repurposing.  
- **Case Studies**: Document real deployments (e.g., satellite repair, disaster response).  
- **AI Models**: Train and share ML models under `ai_integration/models/`.  

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Roadmap
- **v1.0**: Baseline component specs (diodes, resistors, capacitors).  
- **v1.1**: Add environmental interaction data (temperature, humidity, vibration).  
- **v2.0**: Integrate AI datasets and predictive algorithms.  
- **v3.0**: Document cross-component synergies for adaptive systems.
