# Component Failure Repurposing Database

## Overview

This database documents how electronic components can be repurposed when they fail, instead of being discarded as waste. By mapping failure modes to alternate functions, we can create adaptive systems that turn component degradation into new capabilities.

**Philosophy**: Instead of fighting against component failure, we harvest the new characteristics as resources for different applications.
